Once upon a time, there was a 16 year old teenager named Johnny who loved playing basketball. He had been playing since he was a little kid and was incredibly good at the game. However, nobody gave him the chance to play as he was only 5'6. However, one day, as he was walking to school, his life changed. He saw Lebron James as he was walking down the street. Lebron asked him to play basketball and taught him a lot. He brought Lebron to a basketball game at school and began to get very popular
Lebron told Johnny: If you want to be a great basketball player, you should keep playing basketball, no matter what obstacle you might meet with. Johnny was inspired by his words and played basketball harder than before. He spent almost all his spare time playing basketball. One year later, became the captain of the school basketball team, and lead his team to win a regional basketball challenge. 
Ten years later, Johnny is a star in the NBA, playing on the Warriors coached by his idol Lebron James. Johnny is still grateful for the advice LeBron gave him. He looks to mentor the youth in basketball to pass on the help he recieved.
